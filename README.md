# Super Memio Bois
## Ben Stuart

### Overview:
_This is a customized version of the first level of Super Mario Bros that I made in early 2017 during my last semester of high school. Functionality is limited as the game was made as a joke (not that it doesn't demonstrate a solid understanding of Python & OOP)._

### How to Play:
* Make sure you have Python (2 or 3) installed as well as the Pygame module.
* Run the Mario.py file in your IDE or in the command line.

#### Secret Functionality:
1. The game is currently set to spawn you near the end of the map. Take note of bullet 3 in this area.
* Spell out *dat boi*'s name with your keyboard to view his catch phrase.
* Hold ***C*** while traveling across the long brick wall at the end of the stage for a surprise.
