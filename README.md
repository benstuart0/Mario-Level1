# Super Memio Bois
## Ben Stuart

### Overview:
_This is a customized version of the first level of Super Mario Bros that I made in early 2017 during my last semester of high school. Functionality is limited as the game was made as a joke (not that it doesn't demonstrate an understanding of Python OOP)._

#### Secret Functionality:
* Spell out *dat boi*'s name with your keyboard to view his catch phrase.
* Hold ***C*** while traveling across the long brick wall at the end of the stage for a surprise.
